// for the implementation of the k-d tree. Please modify the main() function according to your needs.
// The code is pretty neat and it will not be difficult to understand. Still, will add comments in future if needed.

//Just for writing something, I will write a "Hello World" program below!

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
